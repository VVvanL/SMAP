This plugin analyses the loaded SMLM data and calculates training parameters for DECODE. These 
can then be saved as a '.yaml' file, which is directly read by the DECODE training notebook.

Click on the InOut/calibration_file entry to choose the position of the calibration file ('*_3dcal.mat'). 

gui:Parameters:
gui:loadjson Load a '.yaml'  file and use those values as default.
gui:partablepos 
gui:savejson Save the table as a '.yaml' file to be used directly for DECODE training.
gui:savejson_default Overwrite the default 'DECODE_default.yaml' file with current values.
gui:usecurrent Analyse the currently loaded SMLM data to calculate training parameters.
