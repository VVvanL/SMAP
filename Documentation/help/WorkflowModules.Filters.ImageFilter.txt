Filters the image before peak finding. 
Included are a Gaussian filter (recommended for beads and if the background 
is determined independentely), a Difference-of-Gaussian filter  (works well on most SMLM data) 
and filtering with an experimental PSF (recommended for non-compact PSFs, e.g. the double-helix PSF.

gui:Parameters:
gui:filtermode Filter that is used:\n
DoG: Difference of Gaussian filter. Parameter s is size of the smaller Gaussian, the larger Gaussian is 2.5*s.\n
Gauss: Filter with a Gaussian PSF. Parameter s is size of Gaussian.\n
mean PSF: Correlation with experimental PSF (saved as *3Dcal.mat), averaged over z, and additionally blurred with a Gaussian of size s.\n
MIP PSF: Maximum intensity projection of images correlated with the experimental PSF at different z positions.
gui:loadPSF Load an experimental spline interpolated PSF model (*3Dcal.mat file).
gui:loc_loc_filter_sigma Sigma (in camera pixels) for a Gaussian filter which is applied after background correction and before peak finding. 
 Typical size of PSF in pixels, eg 1 (range: 0.5-5) 
gui:text=loc_loc_filter_sigma;
gui:text2=zrange;
gui:zrange For using experimetnal PSF for peak finding: at which z-positions to probe the PSF for correlation
