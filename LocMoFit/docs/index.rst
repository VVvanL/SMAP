Overview
--------

LocMoFit is a model fitting software for SMLM data. It fits an arbitary geometric model to the localization coordiantes of a segemented structure. LocMoFit is described in the bioRxiv preprint Wu, Y.-L. et al. Maximum-likelihood model fitting for quantitative analysis of SMLM data. 2021.08.30.456756. *bioRxiv* (2021) doi:`10.1101/2021.08.30.456756. <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.30.456756v1>`_

Menu info.
----------
If you are new to LocMoFit, you can find out how to get started via :doc:`Getting statrted` in the menu on the left. We recommend you to install LocMoFit with SMAP, a modular super-resolution microscopy analysis platform for SMLM data we developed.

.. important::
   We recommend you to start with our introductory series by following the tutorial in :doc:`../basics/quickstart`.

:doc:`Structure <../structure>` gives an overview of what LocMoFit has and the relations between different classes.

Pages under **BASICS** contain the necessary information for working with LocMoFit.

Pages under **TUTORIAL** get you familiar with LocMoFit through hands-on tutorials.

Pages under **PROGRAMMING NOTE** contain information for working with LocMoFit through coding.

You can find out other resources LocMoFit provides in pages under **RESOURCE** and API documentations in pages under **API**.
